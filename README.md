# dogbot: the internet connected dog feeder

Dogbot hooks up to the Facebook Live comments and triggers a turn when it hears, "feed the dogs," "feed the puppies," "feed the puppers," or any combination or adjective-modified version of those. "Feed the magnificent glorious puppers" would also trigger the feeder, for example.

[It was a pretty cool day.](https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedAnimals/videos/1191730024182324/)

The dogbot folder contains the code you need to make dogbot run, as well as files for 3D printing a nice holder for a [continuous rotation servo](http://www.amazon.com/RioRand%C2%AE-SM-S4303R-Continuous-Rotation-RR-BR301/dp/B00X7BPI1K) to be mounted on [this dry food feeder](http://www.amazon.com/KCH-06114-GAT100-Indispensable-Dispenser-Control/dp/B00013K8O4).

The code is meant to be loaded onto a [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/) which has particular [cool specifications](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-datasheet/), but it would work with other boards in the Particle ecosystem as well (such as the Electron or Spark Core).

Hooray!
